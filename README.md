# tenzies

A game of tenzies I created in React (HTML, CSS, Javascript), following a tutorial by Bob Ziroll. It is my first project in React I followed from the scratch to work on my React capabilities.
I also added three features without the tutorial - number of roll, highest score, and different colours for different numbers.

It should work in the browser just fine.

I thank Bob Ziroll for his phenomeral course of React which I took on Scrimba.
